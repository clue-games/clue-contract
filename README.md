# CLUE: Decentralized Reward Unlocking Platform

CLUE is a TRON-based decentralized reward unlocking platform, using smart contracts and modern cryptography. CLUE allows monetary rewards to be stored in a disposable wallet and can be claimed using an unlocking code comprised of CLUE ID and the private key of the wallet.

## CLUE Architecture
CLUE uses a unique method to store the reward in a disposable wallet, and use the wallet to generate a public key encrypted message.

Upon creation of the CLUE, the unlocking code generated contains the following information:
```
<CLUE ID>.<Private Key>
```

The unlocking code contains all of the necessary information to unlock the CLUE. The CLUE ID represents the index which CLUE is stored on the smart contract, and the private key is to access the wallet for withdrawals and decrypting the encrypted message.

After CLUE is created, the creator will be able to generate either a QR Code or use our Unlocking API, which uses app links for instant unlocking.

The reward amount can be determined by checking the balance of the address on the disposable wallet.

Once the claimer gains access to the disposable wallet, the claimer can not only withdraw funds but also mark the CLUE as claimed, using  `msg.sender` to verify as the winner. The claimerâ€™s address can be sent to the contract, allowing the claimer to record their address on the CLUE.

Once a CLUE is claimed, the new state of the CLUE is visible to the public, allowing interested parties to discover that the CLUE has been claimed, as well as see the claimer.

The unlocked CLUE can be claimed only once, with just one claimer per CLUE.

## Applications and Use Cases
There are a wide range of applications and use cases. CLUEs can be unlocked using the Unlocking API or a QR code, increasing the range of use cases in the modern connected world.

#### Scavenger Hunts
Allow the players to hunt for the CLUE which may lead to another CLUE, hidden in the encrypted message.

The game can be played both online and offline, providing a platform for all types of scavenger hunts.

#### Contests and Sweepstakes
Organize contests and sweepstakes with guaranteed winners, allow players to see the odds and prizes before participating.
